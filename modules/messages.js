  'You see that timer in the top right? It is counting down to Sunday, September 19 when Improv Everywhere is staging the first of it\'s kind Improv EVERYWHERE mp3 Experiment, a new participatory project at the Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona. All are invited to be a part of it!\n\n'+
  'The mp3 Experminet is an interactive flash mob event where a crowd of participants use headphones to create an epic coordinated experience. The Surrounding browser plug-in synchronizes playback of several unique, but coordinated, audio tracks and enables participants to add their own sounds to the mix.\n\n'+
  'The mp3 Expermient is a one-of-a-kind participatory experience both for participants and those who encounter the performance as participants are piped secret instructions through the synchronized playback in your browser.\n\n'+
  'This event requires paid admission to the National Park, where you can also enjoy the breathtaking vistas. If you can, we recommend catching a sunrise or set over the canyon.\n\n'+
  'Surrounding is completely outdoors and socially distanced.',

  'Thank you for your interest in being part of this first time, Improv EVERYWHERE mp3 experiment. It isn\'t often we get to truly embrace the \'Everywhere\' aspect of our name this fully and so we would like to thank the National Park Services for allowing us to coordinate such a unique experience for our first ever mp3 Experiment on the road. It is an honor to get to host an event like this in a National Park and we hope to be able to continue this in the future.\n\n'+
  'We kindly ask all participants to treat the land you are visiting well. Pick up any litter, and in an effort to keep the park clean, we are waiving the need to have anything on your person for this event. You can improvise on our commands with whatever you do have, but in an effort to keep the park clean we ask you to make sure you pick up after yourselves./n/n'+

  'Natalie and I have been together for 4 years and decided to celebrate quite a lot with a cross country roadtrip! A college graduation, 4 years of dating, the vaccine release for Covid-19 as well as making it through the pandemic (so far).\n'+
  'Our trip will started in Mid August and will go until Mid October. We started near NYC, and will be going across the northern edge of the country with stops in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa, Montana and more, until we hit the West Coast.\n'+
  'When we hit the west coast, we turn south and mostly explore California, but very thoroughly. We plan on stopping at as many cities and national parks as we can, including San Francisco, Yellowstone, L.A., Joshua Tree, and Sequoia as well as others.\n'+
  'When we leave California from the southern end, we start making our way diagonally back through the country towards home, making stops including the Grand Canyon, Phoenix Museum of Music, Nashville, Washington D.C., and more.\n'+
  'Along the way we will be stopping at any roadside attraction that catches our eye and documenting our entire trip here and on Instagram, @thatzanytravelcouple, so follow us on this journey. There will be plenty on surprises along the way.',
